# Contributing to HyperCarrier

We love receiving pull requests! Anything from new carriers to documentation fixes.

Also, we are looking for maintainers for the current version of ReactiveShipping 2.0.

## Standards

* PR should explain what the feature does, and why the change exists.
* PR should include any carrier specific documentation explaining how it works.
* Code _must_ be tested, including both unit and remote tests where applicable.
* Be consistent. Write clean code that follows [Ruby community standards](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
* Code should be generic and reusable.

If you're stuck, ask questions!

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
